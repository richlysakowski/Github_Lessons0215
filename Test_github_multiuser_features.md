Love Will Find Us
Song by Barry White

    Lyrics
    Listen 

Patient
Always, be patient
The way we make love
We take our time
Really get into each other's feelings
It takes time, to touch and feel
Hold and kiss and look, takes time
And when you take your time
Make love in a very passionate way
You tend to enjoy so much more
We really have to be careful, sweetheart
So many times I've seen people trying to rush
Certain things into their lives
That turnout to be a disaster
I've lived long enough to understand
All things comes in time
We must always nourish this relationship
Always spend being time together communicating and relating
Because nothing's ever guaranteed, other than
You're gonna stay the color you are
And one day you'll die
Outside of that, nah
You have to work while you wait
And remember no matter what it is
Whether it's us
Something you want to achieve in your life
Baby if it's meant for you, for me, for us
We're gonna have it, you can believe
Whatever we achieve
Will come with time
Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Locked in to each other
Love will find us, if we wait
Baby, let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time for each other
It's very truth
Baby, it's very real
It's life itself
No matter who you are, where you are
What you're trying to do in your life
The same game applies to everyone
If you conceive it and believe it
You can achieve it, but it's gonna take time
Love will find us along the way
If we stay together
Love will find us, if we stay
Locked in to each other (oh, God)
Love will find us, if we wait (don't hurry, baby)
Baby, let's not hurry (don't hurry)
Love will find us, if we wait
Make time for each other
We're searching for something
Very, very special
And we have to keep working and searching
Searching, working
All things in time
Love will find us along the way (baby)
Can we stay together? (Can we make it together?)
Love will find us, if we stay
Can we stay babe, can we stay babe?
Locked in to each other, ooh, can we baby?
Love will find us, if we wait (can we wait, babe?)
Baby, let's not hurry
Love will find us if we make
Make time, take time babe
Make time together (oh, lord)
Love will find us along the way (it's gonna find us)
If we're together (can we, can we?)
Love will find us, if we stay (can we, can we?)
Lock in to each other (can we stay together?)
Love will find us along the way (babe)
Can we stay together? (Can we make it down?)
Love will find us, if we stay (oh lord, can we stay babe, can we stay babe?)
Lock in to each other (ooh, can we?)
Love will find us, if we wait (can't we wait, babe?)
Baby, let's not hurry (ooh)
Love will find us, if we wait (take time, take time)
